### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub.

I'm primarily focused on developing stable and scalable backend systems using Java and the Spring framework. With extensive experience in data modeling and API development, I strive to meet business requirements to the best of my abilities.<br>

You can find various projects on my GitHub repository that utilize Java and Spring. These projects reflect my approach to software development and backend system design.<br>

From database design to security concerns, I handle various aspects of backend development. Not only do I aim to satisfy user requirements, but I also prioritize performance optimization and code maintenance.<br>

If you have any questions about collaborating with me or my projects, feel free to reach out anytime. I look forward to the opportunity to create great solutions together.<br>

Once again, thank you.
